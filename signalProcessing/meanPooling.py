        If u = 1 / m * âˆ‘_(i=1)^m = xi then is du/dx = 1/m. So we can say we take for every value in the gradient only the
        mth part which would look like this gradient/m. We have to iterate over the gradient and apply this gradient to a
        matrix that is of size m**2 and multiply this matrix by gradientElement over m before integrating it into the
